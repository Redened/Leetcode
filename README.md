### LeetCode #1: Two Sum (Easy)

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`,    
return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution,  
and you may not use the same element twice.

### LeetCode #2: Add Two Numbers (Medium)

You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.  
The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. 

Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

### LeetCode #4: Median of Two Sorted Arrays (Hard)

Given two sorted arrays of size `m` and `n` respectively,  
return the median of the two sorted arrays.

The overall run time complexity should be `O(log (m+n))`.

### LeetCode #20: Valid Parentheses (Easy)

Given a string containing just the characters `(` `)` `{` `}` `[` `]`  
determine if the input string is valid. 

Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.  
Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.  
Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.

### LeetCode #21: Merge Two Sorted Lists (Easy)

You are given the heads of two sorted linked lists.

Merge the two lists into one sorted list.   
The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

Return the head of the merged linked list.
